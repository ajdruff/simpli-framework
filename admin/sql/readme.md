#### MySQL Queries


This directory contains all the sql queries used in the plugin.

* _procs_  The creation scripts for stored procedures.

* dashboard_queries Queries that are normally used for administering MySQL or the Nomstock Ticker.

* example_queries Example queries to jog your memory on syntax

* nstock_procedure_calls Procedure calls to the procedures created by _procs_ scripts

* template_  These are standalone sample scripts that you can use as templates.


####Sugggested Usage

Edit all scripts from within the plugin or from SqlYog or Toad by pointing their query open to this directory. Never make a copy of these scripts and edit them separately.

When altering procedures, be sure to run the script after editing them, so the procedure matches whats in the file.

#### MySQL Queries



If SQL queries are used in this plugin, add them here. It is intended to hold queries that would otherwise be held apart from the plugin and may be lost.

The examples directory shows some real world examples of some of the queries and procs used from other plugins. Note the suggested file naming convention.

* _procs_  The creation scripts for stored procedures.

* common_queries Miscellanous queries that are not specific to the plugin or specific database used

* example_queries Example queries to jog your memory on syntax

* nstock_procedure_calls Procedure calls to the procedures created by _procs_ scripts

* template_  These are standalone sample scripts that you can use as templates.


####Sugggested Usage

Edit all scripts from within the plugin or from SqlYog or Toad by pointing their query open to this directory. Never make a copy of these scripts and edit them separately.

When altering procedures, be sure to run the script after editing them, so the procedure matches whats in the file.

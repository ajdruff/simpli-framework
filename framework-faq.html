                <p>
                        For metaboxes to appear, you must add an 'add_meta_box' function within the 'add_meta_boxes' method within the MenuXXSettings page.

Check the following:


                See the example below with each of these points called out.
                   </p>
                <ol>
                    <li> you have an add_meta_box function added to the settings module.</li>
            <li> the HTML id paramater of the add_meta_box is unique for that page. If not unique, you will only see the last metabox loaded with the same id.</li>
           <li> the callback arguments match the metabox template name</li>
            <li> the menu template contains a call to do_meta_boxes for the group that the metabox is contained in</li>

                </ol></dd>


                <dt>Module Not Found Error</dt>
            <dd><ol>
                    <li>Make sure the name of your module matches the file name. </li>
 <li>Make sure that when you use getModule(), the correct name is passed.</li>
                </ol></dd>


                             <dt>Why aren't my post or plugin settings being recognized?</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>
                        When a plugin is first loaded, it gets its initial setting values from the defaults in lib/Hello/Hello.php. When a post
                        is first created it gets its inital setting values from the defaults in Post.php. Once you've saved these settings, the defaults won't be used again. Therefore, after you've saved the post or saved settings for the first time, any new settings that are added wont be recognized unless you first delete the settings in the database.
                        So do this :
                <ol><li>

                        Check that the setting has been added to lib/Hello/Hello.php  or lib/Hello/Module/Post.php if a post setting</li>

                    <li>

                        Delete the existing settings and reload the defaults. You can do this manually: in phpMyAdmin or equivilent mysql client, do this : delete from wp_options where option_name LIKE '%simpli_hello_options%'  where 'simpli_hello' should be replaced by your plugin's slug.  OR you can use the maintenance buttons 'Reset All Settings to Defaults' or 'Update Settings' . 'Update Settings' will add any new settings that have been added since last saved, without resetting your existing settings to defaults. </li>



                </ol>

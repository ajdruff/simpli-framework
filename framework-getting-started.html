 * Getting started with the Simpli Framework<br />
 * 1) Update all constants to be unique.<br />
 * Do a Case sensitive Project wide Search and replace SIMPLI_HELLO with your unique Capitalised Namespace, in the form 'COMPANY_SHORTNAME' where 'COMPANY' is a unique single word identifier for your or company and 'SHORTNAME' is a single word identifier that identies this plugin<br />
 * 2) Edit the constant values under 'Configure' for your plugin.<br />
 * 3) Rename the directory lib/Hello to match your plugin's shortname, the same 'SHORTNAME' referred to in step 1.<br />
 * 4) Rename the file lib/Hello/Hello.php to match your plugin's shortname, the same 'SHORTNAME' referred to in step 1.<br />
 * 5) In this file only, Search and replace $simpli_hello with a variable name that matches your slug. For example: $mycompany_mypluginname<br />
 6) Do a case sensitive Project wide search and replace, replacing 'Hello_Module' with 'SHORTNAME_Module' . You must have the word 'Module.<br />
 * Edit lib/Hello/Hello.php and at the top, replace 'Class Hello ' with 'Class SHORTNAME' where SHORTNAME is the shortname of your plugin , which also should match the file's name. e.g.: lib/Gallery/Gallery.php should have its class as 'Class Gallery '<br />
 * Do a 'whole word' or 'phrase' search and replace for '@package Hello' and replace with '@package SHORTNAME'<br />
 * Edit the plugin_links function in lib/Hello/Module/Admin.php to match your plugin's values<br />
 * Do the bulk of your coding in lib/Hello/Module/Core.php.<br />
 * Do a project wide search and replace , replacing 'simpli-hello' with 'company-shortname'<br />
 * project wide search and replace, replacing 'Hello_' with 'SHORTNAME_'<br />
 * Edit admin/settings.css as per your requirements for the settings styles<br />
 * Rename lib/Hello/js/simpli_hello_core.js to company_shortname_core.js<br />
 * Create your plugin's settings by first setting their default values in lib/Hello/Hello.php<br />
 * Edit/Create the metabox setting forms that will be used for the settings<br />
 * Edit lib/Hello/Module/Post.php for the indiviual post setting defaults.<br />
 * Edit lib/Hello/Module/Shortcodes.php and add any shortcodes you need. There is an example shortcode that will output 'Hello World!' when [company_shortname] is added to a post.<br />
 * Edit lib/Hello/Module/Menu10Settings.php and edit/delete the updates,support,feedback,and donate metaboxes for your plugin. Be sure to point the source urls to a page on your website that will provide the content for each. These metaboxes are designed to allow you to provide dynamic text to the plugin users without having to push an update out.<br />
 * replace the admin/images/menu.png with a unique 16x16px icon for your menu. You can change the icon source url in the add_menu_page function in Menu10Settings.php<br />
 * Notes about the framework's architecture:<br />
 * Naming conventions for files and modules are important. The names of each of the Module files must match the name of the last part of the class name. For example, the module Admin.php must have class name Hello_Module_Admin<br />
 * The setting template files have the same name as the corresponding setting module files but are lowercased with underscores separating each word.For example,<br />
 * templates/menu10_settings.php matches Menu10Settings.php .<br />
 * To add a new submenu:<br />
 * 1. Duplicate Menu20Settings.php and rename it to Menu30XXXX.php where XXXX is any arbitrary word or words with each word capitalized. Always increase the number the file sorts in order you want the menus to sort. Sorting is important as it determines when WordPress inserts each menu. The Number following the word Menu can be any number you want, its just there to determine sorting.<br />
 * 2. Add a menu template e.g.: admin/templates/menu30_xxxx.php<br />
 * 3. Add metabox templates in the form menu30_xxxx_metabox_yyyy where yyyy is an arbitrary identifier of the metabox<br />
 * 4. Edit the settings module and the templates to customize for your plugin.<br />
 * 5. See a full blown example of how to add metaboxes.<br />
 * <br />
 * Use of Make.sh<br />
 * Make.sh is a tiny bash script that will build a zip file of your plugin, allowing you to script any changes to the final zip, like removing any unnecessary files, etc. It is especially useful if the project is within a git repository.<br />
 * Read the make.sh comments for more info.<br />
 * <br />
 * readme-example.txt , screenshot-1-example.png, screenshot-2-example.png can be used as templates if you plan to publish your plugin to the WordPress directory. See http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_Submission_and_Promotion for more information.<br />
 *<br />
 *<br />
 * Here's an example of how you might do the above steps for a plugin that you want to create named 'Awesome Gallery' and your company name is 'WordPress Gods'<br />
 * 1) search: 'SIMPLI_HELLO' replace with : 'WPGODS_GALLERY'<br />
 * 2) The configure section should look like this ;<br />
 define ('WPGODS_GALLERY_NAME','Awesome Gallery'); .<br />
define ('WPGODS_GALLERY_SHORTNAME','Gallery');<br />
define ('WPGODS_GALLERY_TEXTDOMAIN','wpgods-gallery');<br />
define ('WPGODS_GALLERY_SLUG','wpgods_gallery);<br />
define('WPGODS_GALLERY_DEBUG', false);<br />
 *<br />
3) Rename directory lib/Hello to /lib/Gallery<br />
4) Rename file lib/Gallery/Hello.php to lib/Gallery/Gallery.php<br />
5) search in this file for '$simpli_hello' and replace with: '$wpgods_gallery'<br />
6) search project wide for 'Hello_Module' and replace with: 'Gallery_Module'</p>
